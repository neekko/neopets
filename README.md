## How-To
Click the name of a folder to go to that code's instructions. If you need help, leave a comment in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/neekko/neopets/issues) or ping me on Twitter [@neekko](http://twitter.com/neekko/) (where I'm most active).

## Quick Reference
[**display-all-pets**](https://github.com/neekko/neopets/tree/main/display-all-pets) - disable the pet carousel on your user lookup and display ALL your pets

[**modern-lookup**](https://github.com/neekko/neopets/tree/main/modern-lookup) - a modern redesign of the basic Neopets lookup/layout

[**show-pet**](https://github.com/neekko/neopets/tree/main/show-pet) - make your pet's portrait visible on their lookup

## Image Hosting
I use imgur.com, which currently works without issue and the URLs are nice & short. You will need to add the file extension to the end of the image link that imgur gives you in order for it to show up on your lookup or petpage.

Example:
```html
http://imgur.com/yKT6guP.png
```

(the `.gif` extension doesn't seem to work, but `.jpg` and `.png` are fine!)

## About the Author
Hi, I'm Neekko and I've been playing Neopets on-off for going on 20 years. I'm a professional web developer IRL and I owe *a lot* to Neopets for introducing me to HTML & CSS customization when I was a wee teen. I wouldn't be where I am now without this silly browser game. <3
