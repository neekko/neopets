This is my take on a modern version of the basic Neopets lookup. Nothing fancy other than taking all those old tables and updating their look to something more current. The header and footer are also modified.

## How-To

**!!!WARNING!!!** This lookup is very code heavy and doesn't allow for much customization beyond the bio and sidebar (darn that character limit!). Also be sure to save your previous lookup code/description to your own Github repository or as a .txt or .html file on your computer before using the new one, just in case you change your mind and want to roll back.

Go to [https://www.neopets.com/userinfo.phtml](https://www.neopets.com/userinfo.phtml) and replace all contents of the **About Me** box with the code in the [modern-lookup.html](https://github.com/neekko/neopets/blob/main/modern-lookup/modern-lookup.html) file. You may make any additional changes to the code as you see fit, but please do not remove the `<i>Custom lookup by neekko!</i>` part, which credits the original author.

If you encounter any issues or find any bugs, let me know!
