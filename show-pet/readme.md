**As of April 2022, TNT has fixed pet lookups to display the static image automatically, thus rendering this code obsolete!**

## ~~How-To~~

~~Go to [https://www.neopets.com/quickref.phtml](https://www.neopets.com/quickref.phtml). Click the arrow next to your pet's portrait and select **Edit description**. Copy and paste the following code into the description box:~~

```html
<style>
.flashRIP__2020 {width: 286px; height: 286px; background:url(https://pets.neopets.com/cpn/PETNAME/1/4.png) 50% 50% no-repeat;}
.flashRIP-content__2020 {display: none}
</style>
```

~~Replace **PETNAME** with the name of your pet, then hit *Update Description*.~~

~~Tadah! Now people will actually be able to see your pet when they visit their profile. :)~~

~~**Note:** The pet image is static and will not animate. TNT is still working out that issue... maybe......~~
